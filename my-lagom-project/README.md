Welcome to the String Java Lagom App!

Here are the functions available to use: 
        
        
        Reverse a String:
            CURRENT URL (replace hello with: ->) /api/stringservice/reverse/:word
                - Set the word to the word of your choice.
                - The result of the page would show: "*WORD* in reverse is: *REVERSE OF WORD*"
        
        
        Convert string to lower case:
            CURRENT URL (replace hello with: ->) + /api/stringservice/lower/:word
                - Set the word of your choice.
                - The result of the page would show: "*WORD* in lower case is: *WORD IN LOWERCASE*"

        Add string to a list
            CURRENT URL (replace hello with: ->) + /api/stringservice/add/:word
                - Set the word of your choice.
                - The result of the page would show: "*WORD* added to the list. Here is the current list: [*WORD1*]"
        
        
        Clear the list:
